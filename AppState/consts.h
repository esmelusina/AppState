	State-less application states- they don't need to store data,
	so they could just be functions.

	the Enum here is an enumeration of constants.
	Under the hood, they are numbered: 0, 1, 2, 3...
	They are useful for organizing switches. While they are 
	considered a type, mathematically they behave like unsigned
	integers.
